# Grouper MCP Server Configuration
#
# This is an example configuration file. To use it:
# 1. Copy this file to config/grouper-mcp.properties
# 2. Uncomment and set the properties you want to configure
# 3. Rebuild your application or Docker image
#
# Note: Properties in this file take precedence over environment variables

# ==============================================================================
# Read-Only Mode
# ==============================================================================
# When set to true, the server will only allow read operations (searches,
# queries, retrieving information). All write operations (create, update,
# delete, add/remove members) will be blocked.
#
# This is useful for:
# - Production monitoring and auditing without risk of accidental changes
# - Providing safe access to Grouper data for reporting purposes
# - Running multiple instances where only some should have write access
#
# If set in this properties file, it CANNOT be overridden by the READ_ONLY
# environment variable, making it suitable for building immutable read-only
# Docker images.
#
# Default: false (if not set, falls back to READ_ONLY environment variable)
# grouper-mcp.readOnly=true

# ==============================================================================
# Future Configuration Options
# ==============================================================================
# Additional properties will be added here as new features are implemented.
# Examples might include:
# - Protocol configuration (SSE, WebSocket, etc.)
# - Connection pooling settings
# - Cache configuration
# - Rate limiting options
